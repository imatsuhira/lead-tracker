This app is google chrome extension lead-tracker.
If you want to try it, you can download this repository, then go to chrome extension 
User can put URL on the form and save it to see later, also save current tub url.
This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript to solidify my knowledge I learned past.

## Technical requirements:
* User can type URL on the form and save it.
* User can save URL of current tab.
* User can delete all URLs.
* App saves saved URL in local storage so it's not gone after page refresh.
